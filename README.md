# Neural-Network
This is my Python implementation of a small neural network using the popular <b>Tensorflow</b> libary, made by <b>Google</b>.
This neural network has been trained on the extended MNIST (EMNIST) handwritten digits dataset (280.000 digits in total).
Currently, the network has 2 hidden layers (with 300 neurons each) and has been trained over 10 epochs.

<b>How to use: </b>

Execute the <b>Main.py</b> file. Use the mouse cursor to draw a single digit (0-9) onto the grid. While drawing, you can observe the vertical bars on the left, which
represent the current decision of the neural network.

# Neural-Network
This is my Python implementation of a small neural network using the popular <b>Tensorflow</b> libary, made by <b>Google</b>.
This neural network has been trained on the extended MNIST (EMNIST) handwritten digits dataset (280.000 digits in total).
Currently, the network has 2 hidden layers (with 300 neurons each) and has been trained over 10 epochs. I implemented the GUI using <i>Kivy</i> as well as
<i>PIL</i> (Python Imaging Library).

# How to use:

<b>Download the lastest release</b> and follow the instructions <b>or download the source code</b> and run <i>App.py</i> from an IDE

Execute the <b>Main.py</b> file. Use the mouse cursor to draw a single digit (0-9) onto the grid. While drawing, you can observe the vertical bars on the right, which
represent the current decision of the neural network.
